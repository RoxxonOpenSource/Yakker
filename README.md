### Quickstart

To set up your own instance of reddit to develop with, we have a handy [install script for Ubuntu](https://github.com/RoxxonOpenSource/Yakker/wiki/yakker-install-script-for-Ubuntu) that will automatically install and configure most of the stack.

Alternatively, refer to our [Install Guide](https://github.com/RoxxonOpenSource/Yakker/wiki/Install-guide) for instructions on setting up reddit from scratch. Many frequently asked questions regarding local reddit installs are covered in our [FAQ](https://github.com/RoxxonOpenSource/Yakker/wiki/FAQ).

### APIs

To learn more about Yakker's API, check out our [automated API documentation](http://yakker.app/dev/api) and the [API wiki page](https://github.com/RoxxonOpenSource/Yakker/wiki/API). Please use a unique User-Agent string and take care to abide by our [API rules](https://github.com/RoxxonOpenSource/Yakker/wiki/API#wiki-rules).

Happy hacking!
